Prompt:
A explanation.txt that gives about 4 things that should be changed to use this for real

1. Street address: In order to deliver to our customers we should have a complete address for them. We can add a streetaddress VARCHAR field to the people table for this.

2. Inventory: We should be keeping track of product inventory, unless we're drop shipping. Easiest solution seems to be to add an INT SIGNED to the products table.

2. Email: Every 'person' should have an email in our database. We may be able to use this, down the road, for sending junk mail or setting up logins. This can be a VARCHAR field in the people table.

3. Order time: I used a TIMESTAMP data type for the orderdate in the orders table. We should be logging order times, not just the dates.
